Report:

INC-101 on 2025-01-07 in us-east lasted 37 minutes. Root cause: TLS certificate chain mismatch. Impact: 2.1% checkout failures. Remediation: rolled back edge bundle and renewed intermediates.

Two game days were run: one for cache stampede and one for database failover.

A postmortem retro identified alert fatigue; 19 low-signal alerts were removed.

The platform team set a goal to reduce checkout retries by 20% before Q2 close.
