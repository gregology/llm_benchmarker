Background:

The organization is migrating 180 services from a legacy orchestrator to a new control plane with staged cutovers.

Identity and secrets are moving to a new vault cluster, requiring rotation for 12,000 service accounts.

Network policies are being rewritten to a deny-by-default posture, with 430 explicit allow rules planned.

A new logging pipeline is introducing structured events and a 14-day retention for debug-level traces.

The data team is consolidating job schedulers; nightly batch windows must stay within a 90-minute SLA.

Two regions will run mixed versions for six weeks, which affects traffic shaping and health checks.

The API gateway will shift to mTLS, and certificate issuance will move to an internal CA.

The platform team will introduce a new autoscaler that targets queue depth rather than CPU.

Customer contracts include a 99.95% uptime commitment with 30-minute incident response time.

Rollback plans require the ability to revert within 10 minutes and preserve in-flight requests.
